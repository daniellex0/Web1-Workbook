S13 Essay - IDs, Classes, and Tags

ID - can be used to identify one element. Each element can only have one ID. 
Information stored in an ID should be totally unique to the element it is 
connected to. IDs can be important for browsers- if a url includes a # with
a specific ID in the end, the page will jump to the section with that ID
when it loads. This is also why ID has to only refer to one element- so 
that the browser knows where in the page to jump to by finding that one ID.
In CSS and id is often referred to with #.

Class- can be used to identify multiple elements- so you can use the same class 
on multiple elements. Information stores in a class can be used for many 
different elements. Class can be useful for styling a specific group of elements
in the same way in CSS. 

Elements can have both a class and ID, and in fact this is a good practice.
However if you don't need them, no need to use them. 

Tag - A tag is a short description of an HTML object between < ... /> symbols.
There are many common tags such as <img> for images, <h1> for a headline, <div>
for a division or section, etc. In Css tags can often be referred to for styling
but just referring to them, as opposed to referring to a specific Class or ID.

Both in JS and CSS, specificity plays a role in the selection of HTML elements
because of levels of hierarchy/priority. For instance if multiple conflicting
rules in CSS apply to the same element, a universal selector like * will be
given less priority than a very specific selector such as an ID.
