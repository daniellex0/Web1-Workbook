S09 Essay: Image File Formats

A GIF or 'Graphics Interchange Format' is bitmap format and has a limited 
color palette of 256 colors. This is not good for photographs, and is 
most commonly used for simple memes.

PNG or Portable Network Graphic was designed for internet usage, and is 
the most commonly used image compression format online. This is a raster
file that is not ideal for print, but was made to improve upon gifs.
They can work well for photos online but can end up being large file sizes.
Also importantly, they have transparency.

JPG or Joint Photographic Experts Group is ideal for photographs. It's a 
"lossy raster" file which means that it loses a little information each
time it is saved. These work well with complex colors and can even work in 
print these days. This is the only format of the 4 that cannot be animated.

SVG or Scalable Vector Graphic is ideal for logos and symbols because it
can be scaled up infinitely without losing quality, since it is based on
vector calculations as opposed to pixels. These are often created on 
programs like Adobe Illustrator. Their color can also be edited through CSS.
