S10 Essay: Function vs Form- Using Images in HTML vs CSS

Including web images as part of HTML/Content is recommended when
the image is important and has a purpose: it is part of the content 
that is being presented to the viewer. When visitors print out the
page, this image will be included in the print. Also these images
include a description that is important to make the content accessible
to people with disabilities using screen readers.

Including web images as part of CSS/appearance is recommended when 
the image is purely decorative and not meant to be part of the content
that visitors are consuming. When visitors print a page, the background
image will not show up in the print. These images are simply background
images that are supposed to add an aesthetic addition to the page.
These images can load faster on a page, and they do not stretch along
with text as they would in html.
