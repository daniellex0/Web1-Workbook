S05 Essay: Difference between Front End, Back End, Designer

Web Designers are responsible for designing the layout and look of a website.
A Web Designer asseses a client's needs and plans out a site that will best
serve their needs/their clients', depending on who the audience is. Web Designers
often have graphic design experience and have an eye for aestheics. More
recently, UX design has also become popular in this field and is focused on 
ensuring that customers have the best experiences possible with a website.
A lot of research and iterative design that starts with basic wireframes and 
progresses to final 'high fidelity' mockups is involved.

Front End Developers primarily handle the visual aspects of a website that 
visitors see and experience. This is often referred to as the "client-side" 
part of programming. Front end development features primarily the languages HTML, 
CSS, and Javascript. If only a front end developer works on a site, it is considered
a static site (such as one for a restaurant).

Back End Developers handle everything in the background that is hidden from
visitors - how the sitre works, updates, and changes. They ensure that the data requested by the frontend application 
are delivered. This is often refered to as the "server-side" part of programming.
Backend web development can be much more varied than front end, and features 
languages including Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, .Net and more. Back-end server-side work
is made up of 4 main components: server, database, operating system, and software.
If a backend developer works on a site, it is typically considered a dynamic site,
which requires a database to work properly.

If someone works well in both front end and back end development, they are called
a full-stack developer.
