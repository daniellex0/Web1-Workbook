Web Accessibility

Web Accessibility is important because it makes websites universally
accessible to all people, regardless of any disabilities. One of the
things that is great about the internet is that it can be much more accessible 
for people with disabilities than the physical world, and so any barriers
for them on the internet are problematic and should be remedied wherever
possible. 

Beyond the moral/inclusive reasoning, web accessibility is also very important from
a business aspect. Web accessibility ensures that everyone can visit a
website, thus ensuring more business/traffic. After all web accessibility
is for not only people with disabilities such as auditory, cognitive,
visual, and physical, but also people with chaging abilities due to aging,
temporary or situational disabilities, or slow internet connection with
limited or expensive bandwidth.

Even more serious, there is legal liability if a website is not accessible
as any other public soace, and websites/companies can be sued by disabled
users per the ADA if they are not accesible enough. While there are no 
enforceable ADA standards currently, companies can still be successfully sued
and can end up spending a lot in legal fees or fines as a result. Companies such 
as Netflix have been sued many times, and have had to make accommodations accordingly.
