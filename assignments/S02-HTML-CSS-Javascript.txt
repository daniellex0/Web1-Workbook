HTML, CSS, and Javascript are three different coding languages that 
are the building blocks of front-end web development. Essentially, 
they are what make up a website experience for users.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the content of a website, i.e. the text. 
HTML is hierarchical and categorizes text by different categories/importance 
(headline vs. body) using size, bolding, etc. It provides structure to a 
sight and is its “skeleton.”

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) creates the visual experience of a website. 
Without CSS, websites would be plain white pages with basic black text. 
CSS adds aesthetic, stylistic components to HTML, including colors, 
typefaces, layouts, and responsive features). CSS is used to improve 
the “look and feel” of websites and better align with branding aesthetic.

Javascript makes websites interactive, and is the most complex of the 
three. Instead of only being able to look at a website, Javascript 
allows users to actively engage with the site, whether that be through 
forms, logging in, submitting information, commenting, creating an 
account, etc.
