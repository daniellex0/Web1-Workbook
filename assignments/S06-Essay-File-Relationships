File Relationships

A site relative file path is a URL to a file in the same website. 
For instance if a page is linking to another page in the same site,
it can include a relative file path (which would look something
like /directory-name/page-name.html without the domain name in the 
beginning). This loads faster than absolute file paths.

A document relative path is the best path to use for a link to a document that is in the same
folder (and likely to stay together) in a website. The best way to link a document 
relative path is to leave out any part of the path that is the same
between the two documents, and only leave the part that is different.

Absolute file paths start with the domain name, i.e.
 http://www.domain-name/folder-name/page-name.html. These take longer
to load than relative file paths. An absolute file path is useful
for loading links on other websites, but is not adviseable for linksin 
the same website because it requires more server requests and would
use more bandwidth for users with mobile data plans.
