Final Project Website Plan

My final project website will be a blog-like site for articles- news, 
think pieces, etc. 

There will be a front page with articles listed out, and the option to
select the articles of interest and view a full expanded version of
each on separate pages. There will also be an About page. Finally, there 
will be a navigation for visitors to choose between different sections of 
the site.

Each article will have a title with blocks of text and photos throughout.
There may be a sidebar with background information about the article.

I chose to make a journalistic website because I was always interested 
in writing articles and interviewing people, so this can be a good push
to actually do that with this website.
