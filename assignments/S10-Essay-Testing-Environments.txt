S10 Essay: Testing Environments

Local: This testing environment is private- only one developer and the computer. 
This is the easiest place to make any changes. This is the last step before
a shared environement, so it's important to do as much testing and debugging
as possible before merging to a shared environement so that nothing breaks.

Dev: This is an environement shared with other developers. Often tests may fail 
here even though they worked in the Local phase, because now they are integrated
with the entire site and might break since they are no longer autonomous. Any
developers can access your work now.

QA: In this environment the QA team now runs manual tests on your work. This is
a lot more controlled- while in the Dev environment any Developer can make changes
at any moment, in the QA environment the QA team has control on any changes. This
is a stage to catch not just tech issues but also user flow ones. This is made to
simulate the real production environment as much as possible.

Production: This is when the product goes 'live' and is launched to the public.
It is important that all major mistakes are caught in previous testing 
environments so that no major issues show up for the public when they are using the
site. Sometimes there is phased production rollout, in which changes show up only
for a portion of users first.
