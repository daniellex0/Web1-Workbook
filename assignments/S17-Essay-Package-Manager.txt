S17 Essay: Package Managers

environments and easily download external dependencies in order to
automate the process of downloading programs in a consistent manner.
It keeps track of the software that is already on your computer, and
allows you to easily download new software. They are essentially used
to atuomate the process of installing/upgrading/removing programs.

software developers to download all of the necessary dependencies to 
make a packaged program work on their computer/device, including in
application-level package management.
