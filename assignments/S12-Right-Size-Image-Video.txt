S12 Essay: the right size for an image or video asset 

The right size for an image or video asset on a site depends on the 
context. There is not 'one size fits all' measurement, but instead
many factors need to be considered. The size will be different 
depending on whether the image or video needs to be full-screen or 
small, high quality or basic,and what kind of website it will be on
(social media, news, etc).

However, some general guidelines include:

Large or full-screen images should be no larger than 1MB, to ensure
that the site can load quickly and performs well with SEO. Most
other small web graphics can be 300KB or less.

A full-screen background should be about 2000px wide.

Resolution: While printers often require minimum 300dpi, most 
computer monitors are 72 or 92 dpi, so anything higher than
that is unecessary and will only slow down the page.

Some common web image and video aspect ratios are 1:1 (square),
3:2 (rooted in 35mm film and photography, common in print), 
4:3 (common for tv and computer monitors), 16:9 ration (recently
became the standard for flatscreens- common resolutions in this
ratio are 1920x1080 and 1280 x 720) Also 320x240, 400x600, 800x600, 
1024x768.
