S15 Essay: CSS Preprocessor

A CSS Preprocessor is a tool that extends the functionality of classic 
CSS by adding a wide variety of new options and syntaxt that us more
similar to javascript and other programming languages in the scope
of options it provides to the programmer with CSS. CSS Preprocessors
add many additional useful features to CSS such as variables (which can
be reused throughout a site and save a lot of time/headache),imports,
mixins, extend (grabbing the CSS styling of one element to another),
mathematical calculations, loops, and more.

Examples are Sass, Less, and Stylus.

In React, Styled components is a CSS in JS tool that solves the issues
that sometimes arise between component-based React programming and
CSS styling. While styling classically works for an entire site,
the component-based approach of React breaks websites into pieces.
Styled components allows the styling to apply only to specific
components.


Styled Components violate separation of concerns by combining CSS
with Javascript, instead of keeping them separate as separation
of concerns recommends.
