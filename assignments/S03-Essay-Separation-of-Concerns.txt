Separation of Concerns

Separation of concerns in regards to HTML, CSS, and Javascript refers 
to keeping code modular - making sure that changes to an application 
won’t accidentally break another unrelated part of the website. 
The term has been around for over 40 years, and refers to the 
idea that programs should have separate sections. 

Separating “concerns” in front-end between languages can improve 
the quality of and ability to maintain a project. For instance, 
using SASS elements can ensure that HTML and CSS stay in their separate lanes. 

With this approach, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do not overlap in their 
responsibilities, and so applications because a lot more flexible 
and easier to maintain.
